A library of queues that enable sending ordered tasks from synchronous to asynchronous contexts.

## Task Ordering and Swift Concurrency

Tasks sent from a synchronous context to an asynchronous context in Swift Concurrency are inherently unordered. Consider the following test:

```swift
@MainActor
func test_mainActor_taskOrdering() async {
    var counter = 0
    var tasks = [Task<Void, Never>]()
    for iteration in 1...100 {
        tasks.append(Task {
            counter += 1
            XCTAssertEqual(counter, iteration) // often fails
        })
    }
    for task in tasks {
        _ = await task.value
    }
}
```

Despite the spawned `Task` inheriting the serial `@MainActor` execution context, the ordering of the scheduled asynchronous work is not guaranteed.

While [actors](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html#ID645) are great at serializing tasks, there is no simple way in the standard Swift library to send ordered tasks to them from a synchronous context.

### Executing asynchronous tasks in FIFO order

Use a `FIFOQueue` to execute asynchronous tasks enqueued from a nonisolated context in FIFO order. Tasks sent to one of these queues are guaranteed to begin _and end_ executing in the order in which they are enqueued.

```swift
let queue = FIFOQueue()
queue.async {
    /*
    `async` context that executes after all other enqueued work is completed.
    Work enqueued after this task will wait for this task to complete.
    */
    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000)
}
queue.async {
    /*
    This task begins execution once the above one-second sleep completes.
    */
}
Task {
    await queue.await {
        /*
        `async` context that can return a value or throw an error.
        Executes after all other enqueued work is completed.
        Work enqueued after this task will wait for this task to complete.
        */
    }
}
```

### Sending ordered asynchronous tasks to Actors

Use an `ActorQueue` to send ordered asynchronous tasks from a nonisolated context to an `actor` instance. Tasks sent to one of these queues are guaranteed to begin executing in the order in which they are enqueued. Ordering of execution is guaranteed up until the first [suspension point](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html#ID639) within the called `actor` code.

```swift
let queue = ActorQueue()
queue.async {
    /*
    `async` context that executes after all other enqueued work has begun executing.
    Work enqueued after this task will wait for this task to complete or suspend.
    */
    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000)
}
queue.async {
    /*
    This task begins execution once the above task suspends due to the one-second sleep.
    */
}
Task {
    await queue.await {
        /*
        `async` context that can return a value or throw an error.
        Executes after all other enqueued work has begun executing.
        Work enqueued after this task will wait for this task to complete or suspend.
        */
    }
}
```
