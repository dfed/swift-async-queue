/// A queue that enables enqueing ordered asynchronous tasks from a nonisolated context onto an adopted actor's isolated context.
/// Tasks are guaranteed to begin executing in the order in which they are enqueued. However, if a task suspends it will allow subsequently enqueued tasks to begin executing.
/// This queue exhibits the execution behavior of an actor: tasks sent to this queue can re-enter the queue, and tasks may execute in non-FIFO order when a task suspends.
///
/// An `ActorQueue` ensures tasks sent from a nonisolated context to a single actor's isolated context begin execution in order.
/// Here is an example of how an `ActorQueue` should be utilized within an actor:
/// ```swift
/// public actor LogStore {
///
///     public init() {
///         queue.adoptExecutionContext(of: self)
///     }
///
///     nonisolated
///     public func log(_ message: String) {
///         queue.enqueue { myself in
///             myself.logs.append(message)
///         }
///     }
///
///     nonisolated
///     public func retrieveLogs() async -> [String] {
///         await queue.enqueueAndWait { myself in myself.logs }
///     }
///
///     private let queue = ActorQueue<LogStore>()
///     private var logs = [String]()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Precondition: The lifecycle of an `ActorQueue` must not exceed that of the adopted actor.
