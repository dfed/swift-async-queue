/// A queue that executes asynchronous tasks enqueued from a nonisolated context.
/// Tasks are guaranteed to begin executing in the order in which they are enqueued. However, if a task suspends it will allow subsequently enqueued tasks to begin executing.
/// Asynchronous tasks sent to this queue execute as they would in an `actor` type, allowing for re-entrancy and non-FIFO behavior when an individual task suspends.
///
/// An `ActorQueue` is used to ensure tasks sent from a nonisolated context to a single `actor`'s isolated context begin execution in order.
/// Here is an example of how an `ActorQueue` should be utilized within an `actor`:
/// ```swift
/// public actor LogStore {
///
///     nonisolated
///     public func log(_ message: String) {
///         queue.async {
///             await self.append(message)
///         }
///     }
///
///     nonisolated
///     public func retrieveLogs() async -> [String] {
///         await queue.await { await self.logs }
///     }
///
///     private func append(_ message: String) {
///         logs.append(message)
///     }
///
///     private let queue = ActorQueue()
///     private var logs = [String]()
/// }
/// ```
///
