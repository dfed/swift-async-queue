         This test is tricky to pull off!
         Our requirements:
         1. We need to call `wait()` before `signal()`
         2. We need to ensure that the `wait()` call suspends _before_ we call `signal()`
         3. We can't `await` the `wait()` call on the test's queue before calling `signal()` since that would deadlock the test.
         4. We must utilize a single actor's isolated context to avoid accidental interleaving when suspending to communicate across actor contexts.

         In order to ensure that we are executing the `wait()` calls before we call `signal()` _without awaiting a `wait()` call_,
         we utilize the Sempahore's ordered execution context to enqueue ordered `Task`s similar to how an ActorQueue works.
